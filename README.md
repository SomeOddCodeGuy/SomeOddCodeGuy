## About
***
I'm a developer who's been visiting world of LLMs as a hobby since 2023. My main focus is on locally run, offline,
LLMs which I mostly use for even more hobby tinkering. 

I generally do most of my development on a local Git repository on my home network, and then push everything up here at once. 
I do most of my commits on weekends, and in some rare cases I might do one late at night on weekdays.

I'm quite passionate in regards to the power of workflows with LLMs, and as a developer I generally prefer more manual
chat-style interfacing with LLMs powered by workflows than I do leaving a task to an automated agent. There are some
exceptions, however; web searching is a great use of agents, IMO. 

But as a developer, with the current tech (as of 2025-03), I feel that I can iterate faster and cleaner sitting in 
between the AI and my code.


## Wilmer
***
I started Wilmer during the Llama 2 era based on the idea that open-weight models at the time were weak as generalists
compared to the big proprietary models like ChatGPT; however, individual fine-tunes within scoped domains (like coding
or medical) could often compete with those big models. My goal has always been to try to find a way, either through
routing or workflows, to help my local models keep pace with the big APIs. 

Obviously, modern open-weight models are strong enough to not need that help nearly as much, but that just means the same 
methods can push those models even farther.

I'm not a python developer by trade; I picked it up to work on Wilmer, and I've been learning it ever since. Some
of the mess in the codebases here are tech debt due to my fumbling along and learning early on as I started to 
understand it more. In my day job, I'm a dev manager that mostly works with C# and web tech.

### [My Home Setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1kz1c/sharing_my_unorthodox_home_setup_and_how_i_use/)
- Last updated 2025-01
- I recently got an M3 Studio that I've added to the mix, allowing me to separate out coding models from general purpose
  models, and giving Roland its own box.

### [My Guide to How I Develop Using LLMs](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cvw3s5/my_personal_guide_for_developing_software_with_ai/)
- Guide is a bit older now, but still applies. I've automated a lot of this in workflows, but when I'm somewhere like
  my work, I'd still make use of these techniques.
- Many of my Wilmer workflows are in some part inspired by the general workflows I do here
